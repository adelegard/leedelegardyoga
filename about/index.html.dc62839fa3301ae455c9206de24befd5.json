For me, the study and practice of Asana is an extension of this inquiry.</p>\n<p>Yoga lays our physical and mental health bare, you can’t hide anything from yourself on the mat. Daily habits like slouching over a computer screen or carrying your bag on your left shoulder, combine with chronic emotional states to create our internal landscapes of well (or unwell) being. </p>\n<p>Yoga is a tool, a Practice of self study through which to illuminate our hidden patterns and default tendencies, and to cultivate the resources necessary to change them.</p>\n<p>I earned my 200-hour yoga teacher training from Kula Yoga in NYC and currently study Iyengar Yoga with Nikki Costello.  I am grateful to all my teachers, wise women who have taught me to be ceaselessly curious and to trust the path.</p>\n","__filename":"about.md","__url":"/about/","__resourceUrl":"/about/index.html","__dataUrl":"/about/index.html.dc62839fa3301ae455c9206de24befd5.json"}
