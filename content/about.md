I believe yoga can change your life. It changed mine. 

Yoga lays our physical and mental health bare, you canâ€™t hide anything from yourself on the mat. Daily habits like slouching over a computer screen or carrying your bag on your left shoulder, combine with chronic emotional states to create our internal landscapes of well (or unwell) being. 

I view yoga as an antidote to modern existence; a path to heal and strengthen the connection between mind-body and a relationship to the present moment. Yoga is a tool, a Practice of self study through which to illuminate our hidden patterns and default tendencies, and to cultivate the resources necessary to change them. 

My whole life, whether it was through art and gymnastics, or later earning my MFA in sculpture, I have always had a relationship to the inquiry of form. For me, the study and practice of Asana is an extension of this inquiry.
Inspired by my teacher Nikki Costello who is trained in the Iyengar Yoga lineage, I teach a challenging vinyasa hybrid that is rooted in principles of alignment, intelligent sequencing, and anatomy. I earned my 200-hour yoga teacher training from Kula Yoga in NYC and am currently a student of Iyengar Yoga. I am grateful to all my teachers, wise women who have taught me to be ceaselessly curious and to trust the Path.
