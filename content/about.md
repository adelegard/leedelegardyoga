<div class="small-font">

Whatever you are feeling<br>
in your body or mind,<br> 
watch it. 

Give it a color.<br>
A weight.<br>
An outline.<br>

Try to see the shape of what you don’t yet know. 

And when you catch a glimpse<br>
of that vulnerability,<br>
that ignorance,<br>
that invisible pattern or infinite spiral...

when you catch a glimpse<br>
of that unknown form<br>
don't be embarrassed or look away.<br>
Stare at it.<br>

Witness.<br> 

Try to see the shape of what you don’t yet know.<br>

And feel  that it is not you<br>
and you are not it.<br> 
Breathe into that distance<br>
because in that space    between

Everything is waiting for you.<br>

I believe yoga can change your life. It changed mine. 

Yoga lays our physical and mental health bare, you can’t hide anything from yourself on the mat. Daily habits like slouching over a computer screen or carrying your bag on your left shoulder, combine with chronic emotional states to create our internal landscapes of well (or unwell) being. 

I view yoga as an antidote to modern existence; a path to heal and strengthen the connection between mind-body and a relationship to the present moment. Yoga is a tool, a Practice of self study through which to illuminate our hidden patterns and default tendencies, and to cultivate the resources necessary to change them. 

Strongly influenced by my teacher Nikki Costello who is trained in the Iyengar Yoga lineage, I teach a challenging vinyasa hybrid that is rooted in principles of alignment, intelligent sequencing, and anatomy. I also continue to study with Jillian Turecki, Nikki Vilella and Alex Auder in the Hatha yoga/ vinyasa tradition. I am grateful to all my teachers, wise women who have taught me to be ceaselessly curious and to trust the path.
