My whole life, whether it was through art and gymnastics, or later earning my MFA in sculpture, I have always had a relationship to the inquiry of form. For me, the study and practice of Asana is an extension of this inquiry.

Yoga lays our physical and mental health bare, you canâ€™t hide anything from yourself on the mat. Daily habits like slouching over a computer screen or carrying your bag on your left shoulder, combine with chronic emotional states to create our internal landscapes of well (or unwell) being. 

Yoga is a tool, a Practice of self study through which to illuminate our hidden patterns and default tendencies, and to cultivate the resources necessary to change them.

I earned my 200-hour yoga teacher training from Kula Yoga in NYC and currently study Iyenar Yoga with Nikki Costello.  I am grateful to all my teachers, wise women who have taught me to be ceaselessly curious and to trust the Path.
