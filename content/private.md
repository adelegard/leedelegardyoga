I am available to teach private sessions in your home or at Kula Yoga Project in their Soho, Tribeca, or Williamsburg locations. I am passionate about working one-on-one with clients of any experience level to develop personalized goals. Perhaps you are looking to gain strength, mobility, or work through (or prevent!) an injury? Or maybe you want to cultivate a calmer mind and relationship to the present moment? 
People come to yoga for many reasons... whatâ€™s yours? 

To ask a question, inquire about rates, or schedule a private yoga session please email me.
